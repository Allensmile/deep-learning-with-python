# Exercises for the book "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet.
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing the code samples found in the book [Deep Learning with Python (Manning Pubblications)](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff) by François Chollet, gathered by chapter.

## Disclaimer
The author [already published notebooks with the exercises in his Github account](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks). Those you can find in this repository are made by myself for my own learning, with no intention so steal any intellectual property.

## Requiements
- Create a virtual environment with `conda` or `virtualenv`. Recommended `conda` with Python 3.6.
```
conda create --name <your_project> python=3.6
```
- Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contents
The exercises in the book are written for `tensorflow 1.*` and `Keras 2.0.8`. All the code in this repo have been rewritten to work with `tensorflow 2.1.*` and the corresponding Keras version `2.2.4-tf`.
